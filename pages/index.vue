              Experienced Developer proficient in Dart, JavaScript, and Python.
              I've mainly worked on frontend development for both web and
              mobile. Mobile development has been with either Flutter or some
              native Android development. Whereas web development have been done
              with Vue and React.

              I also have a education as a biologist, where I've worked mainly
              within Zoophysiology. This includes laboratory work with several
              mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and insects. This work has led to a
              published peer-reviewed article, on insect cold physiology.
              Dataanalysis has been performed with the use of Python, MatLab,
              and R.
